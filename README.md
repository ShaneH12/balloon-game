# balloon-game

Worked with another student for a school assignment to create a ballon popup game. 

We used JS to have random pop up circles appear on the screen containing either an image or a gif. 

The player's goal was to click the popup as quickly as possible.

The time was then recorded as to how quick the player was able to click on the popup image/gif.
